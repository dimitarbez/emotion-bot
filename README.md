# EmotionBot ‚Äî Emotionally-Driven Chatbot

EmotionBot is an emotionally-aware conversational AI that maintains a dynamic emotional state and lets that state influence every response. Built as a modular, self-contained system, it demonstrates how a small set of components can work together to create natural, emotionally intelligent conversations.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Emotion Tracking**: Tracks continuous valence (-1 to 1) and arousal (0 to 1) values
- **9 Discrete Emotions**: neutral, joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, curiosity, affection  
- **üé≠ Personality System**: 7 distinct personality types that influence emotional responses and conversation style
- **Intelligent Appraisal**: Uses transformer models (sentiment analysis + GoEmotions) with graceful fallbacks
- **Adaptive Response Generation**: OpenAI GPT integration with local fallback system
- **Dynamic Style Adaptation**: Adjusts verbosity, directness, warmth, punctuation, and emoji usage
- **Live Visualization**: Real-time matplotlib plotting of emotional state evolution
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context and tracks discussion topics
- **Robust Configuration**: Easily tunable emotional dynamics and behavior parameters

## üß† How It Works

1. **Input Appraisal**: Transformer models (DistilBERT + GoEmotions) analyze user text for sentiment and discrete emotions, with neutral fallbacks when models are unavailable.

2. **Core Affect Update**: The system maintains continuous valence (negative‚Üîpositive) and arousal (calm‚Üîexcited) values. New inputs create deltas that are:
   - Scaled by input intensity for stronger impact from emphatic messages  
   - Dampened by configurable inertia to prevent emotional whiplash
   - Subject to exponential decay back toward baseline over time

3. **Discrete Emotion Selection**: Maps current (valence, arousal) coordinates to the nearest emotion in EMOTION_MAP using Euclidean distance, with minimum duration requirements to prevent flickering and force-switch capability for high-intensity inputs.

4. **Response Generation**: A "brain" module creates base responses using either:
   - **OpenAI GPT**: Emotion-aware system prompts with GPT-4o-mini (when `OPENAI_API_KEY` available)
   - **Local Heuristics**: Deterministic templates with emotion-specific response patterns

5. **Behavioral Styling**: The behavior module post-processes responses by adjusting:
   - Length based on verbosity and arousal levels
   - Directness (hedging vs. assertiveness) 
   - Warmth markers and emoji probability
   - Punctuation patterns and hesitation markers

The conversation history is stored in `ConversationMemory` which provides context windows to the brain module and tracks discussion topics over time.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

EmotionBot follows a clean, modular architecture where the CLI orchestrates specialized components:

```
user input
     ‚îÇ
     ‚ñº
 appraise() ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
     ‚îÇ sentiment/intensity  ‚îÇ
     ‚ñº                     ‚îÇ
EmotionState ‚Üê decay ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
     ‚îÇ current emotion

Brain.generate_base() ‚îÄ‚îÄ Memory.recent_context()
     ‚îÇ base reply
     ‚ñº
behavior.shape()
     ‚îÇ

```

### üì¶ Core Modules

- **`main.py`**: CLI orchestration and the `emotional_update()` pipeline. Handles decay, appraisal integration, core affect updates, and discrete emotion selection.

- **`emotions.py`**: Defines `EmotionState` dataclass with exponential decay, inertia-dampened updates, and the `EMOTION_MAP` for discrete emotion selection based on (valence, arousal) coordinates.

- **`personality.py`**: üé≠ **NEW** Personality system with 7 distinct types (enthusiast, analyst, supporter, challenger, creative, guardian, balanced). Modifies emotional responses, behavioral patterns, and conversation style.

- **`nlp.py`**: NLP processing with transformer models. Wraps DistilBERT sentiment analysis and GoEmotions classification, returning `Appraisal` objects with graceful fallbacks when models are missing.

- **`memory.py`**: Conversation storage and context management. Maintains transcript history, provides context windows for response generation, and tracks topic frequency.

- **`brain.py`**: Response generation engine. Integrates OpenAI Chat Completions with sophisticated emotion-aware prompting, falling back to template-based local generation when needed.

- **`behavior.py`**: Post-processing for emotional styling. Applies emotion-specific adjustments to length, hedging, punctuation, emoji usage, and conversational markers.

- **`telemetry.py`**: Real-time visualization with matplotlib. Plots valence/arousal evolution over time with discrete emotion annotations.

- **`config.py`**: Centralized configuration for decay constants, emotion weights, OpenAI settings, and behavioral parameters.

## üí¨ Using the CLI

### Basic Interaction
Simply type messages and press Enter to chat with the bot. The emotional state will evolve based on the conversation.

### Special Commands
- **`:state`** - Display current valence, arousal, and discrete emotion
- **`:personality`** - üé≠ View current personality profile and traits
- **`:switch <type>`** - üé≠ Change personality (enthusiast, analyst, supporter, challenger, creative, guardian, balanced)
- **`:quit`** or **`:q`** - Exit the conversation gracefully
- **`Ctrl+C`** - Force quit

### Visualization
A matplotlib window displays:
- **Blue line**: Valence over time (-1 to 1)
- **Orange line**: Arousal over time (0 to 1)
- **Title**: Current discrete emotion
- **Info box**: Detailed emotional state metrics

### üé≠ Personality Types

Choose from 7 distinct personality types that influence conversation style:

- **Enthusiast**: Energetic, optimistic, and highly expressive
- **Analyst**: Logical, formal, and detail-oriented  
- **Supporter**: Empathetic, caring, and emotionally supportive
- **Challenger**: Direct, assertive, and action-oriented
- **Creative**: Imaginative, playful, and unconventional
- **Guardian**: Responsible, traditional, and security-focused
- **Balanced**: Moderate traits across all dimensions (default)

Each personality affects emotional sensitivity, response style, baseline mood, and conversation patterns.

## üìà Emotional Model Details

### Core Affect Theory
EmotionBot implements a computational model based on Russell's Circumplex Model of Affect:
- **Valence**: Pleasant ‚Üî Unpleasant dimension (-1 to 1)
- **Arousal**: Low ‚Üî High activation dimension (0 to 1)

### Discrete Emotions Mapping
Each emotion maps to typical (valence, arousal) coordinates:

| Emotion   | Valence | Arousal | Characteristics |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| joy       | +0.7    | 0.6     | Happy, enthusiastic |
| sadness   | -0.7    | 0.3     | Melancholic, subdued |
| anger     | -0.6    | 0.8     | Hostile, energetic |
| fear      | -0.8    | 0.7     | Anxious, vigilant |
| surprise  | +0.2    | 0.9     | Startled, alert |
| disgust   | -0.6    | 0.5     | Repulsed, withdrawn |
| curiosity | +0.2    | 0.5     | Inquisitive, engaged |
| affection | +0.6    | 0.4     | Warm, caring |
| neutral   | 0.0     | 0.2     | Baseline, calm |

### Dynamic Behavior
- **Exponential Decay**: Emotions naturally return to baseline over time
- **Inertia Dampening**: Prevents unrealistic emotional whiplash
- **Intensity Scaling**: Stronger inputs create proportionally larger changes
- **Force Switching**: High-intensity or anger inputs can immediately override minimum duration rules

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: The bot responses are generic/not emotional**
- Ensure transformer models are properly installed: `pip install transformers torch`
- Check if OPENAI_API_KEY is set for more sophisticated responses
- Verify emotional state is changing with `:state` command

**Q: Matplotlib window doesn't appear**
- Install GUI backend: `pip install PyQt5` or similar
- On headless systems, the bot will still work without visualization

**Q: Import errors with transformers**
- Ensure all requirements are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- The system gracefully degrades to neutral appraisals if transformers is missing

**Q: OpenAI responses not working**
- Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set
- Check API key has sufficient credits
- The system falls back to local responses automatically
